This is my work-in-progress attempt to learn OpenMAX.


image_render does not work at the moment - no image is displayed.


core/openmax.py bindings are taken from
peterderivaz's https://github.com/peterderivaz/pyopenmax


With some more time available I will definitley continue learning OpenMAX
(as well as try to get this code a little bit more useful for other people).
